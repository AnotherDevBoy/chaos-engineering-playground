# chaos-engineering-playground
## Motivation
No matter if you work for any the **GAFAM**, a medium-sized company or a startup, we live in a world where microservices and distributed systems are part of the day-to-day job of a **Software Engineer** and where **Software Testers/Automated QA** are not widely present in the workforce.

In this context, we need to make use of all the tools that are available to us to prevent issues from impacting *Production* environments and therefore our customers.

My goal with this pet-project is to be able to bring and evangelize **Chaos engineering** to work and ensure we all build highly available and resilient services. However, I will also take this opportunity to write a blog series (SoonTM) and share my learnings with the rest of the community.

## What is Chaos Engineering?
Based on Wikipedia's definition:
> Chaos engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a software system in production in order to build confidence in the systemâ€™s capability to withstand turbulent and unexpected conditions.

In practice, Chaos Engineering can be thought of as the facilitation of experiments to uncover systemic weaknesses. These experiments follow four steps:
- Start by defining "steady state" as some measurable output of a system that indicates normal behavior.
- Hypothesize that this steady state will continue in both the control group and the experimental group.
- Introduce variables that reflect real world events like servers that crash, hard drives that malfunction, network connections that are severed, etc.
- Try to disprove the hypothesis by looking for a difference in steady state between the control group and the experimental group.

## The app
To run the experiments against something that can be somewhat representative of a "real-life" service, I decided to build a small app with:
- An HTTP API endpoint.
- [MySQL](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server) database.

Even with this small example, we can easily reproduce issues that will impact any application with a similar architecture and find ways to mitigate them.

The architecture can be summarized with the following diagram:

## The tools
There are a few open-source tools that I will use to run the experiments and visualize the results:
- [Toxiproxy](https://github.com/shopify/toxiproxy): to generate chaos between the API and the database.
- [Locust](https://github.com/locustio/locust): to generate traffic against the API.
- [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb) + [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana): to capture application metrics and visualize them.
- [Docker](https://github.com/docker) + [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose): to be able to run everything on my laptop.
